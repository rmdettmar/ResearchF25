scenario: AllZerosInput
description: Input a 32-bit vector with all bits set to 0. This serves as a baseline test to confirm that the module correctly processes the simplest input with no data change expected after reversal.

scenario: AllOnesInput
description: Input a 32-bit vector with all bits set to 1. This tests the module's ability to handle maximum data density and ensures no bits are dropped or incorrectly handled during byte reversal.

scenario: AlternatingBitsPattern
description: Input a 32-bit vector with an alternating pattern of 1s and 0s (e.g., 101010...10). This tests the module's ability to handle bit patterns that change frequently, ensuring byte boundaries are respected.

scenario: ByteBoundaryTest
description: Input a vector where each byte has distinct values (e.g., 0x01020304). This scenario checks if each byte is independently reversed correctly, verifying the module's byte-level processing.

scenario: SingleByteSet
description: Input a vector with only one byte set to a non-zero value (e.g., 0x000000FF). This tests the module's handling of isolated high bits within a single byte.

scenario: SequentialBytesIncreasing
description: Input a vector with sequentially increasing byte values (e.g., 0x01020304). This verifies the preservation and correct reversal of sequence order across the byte boundaries.

scenario: SequentialBytesDecreasing
description: Input a vector with sequentially decreasing byte values (e.g., 0x04030201). This serves as a counter-test to the increasing sequence, ensuring the module correctly reverses the order back to the original sequence post-reversal.

scenario: RandomBits
description: Input a vector with a random bit pattern (e.g., 0xA5A5A5A5). This scenario is designed to confirm that arbitrary data patterns are handled correctly, with each byte being reversed irrespective of the bit pattern.
