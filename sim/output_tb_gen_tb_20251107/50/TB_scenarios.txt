scenario: AllZeroInputs
description: Set inputs a, b, and c to 0 (000) to verify the output is 0, as defined in the Karnaugh map.

scenario: AllOneInputs
description: Set inputs a, b, and c to 1 (111) to verify the output is 1, as defined in the Karnaugh map.

scenario: SingleOneInputAtA
description: Set inputs a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 (100) to verify the output is 1, testing the transition from a low to high state.

scenario: SingleOneInputAtB
description: Set inputs a = 0, b = 1, c = 0 (010) to verify the output is 1, ensuring functionality when only b is high.

scenario: SingleOneInputAtC
description: Set inputs a = 0, b = 0, c = 1 (001) to confirm the output is 1, testing the case where only c is high.

scenario: ABEqualHigh
description: Set inputs a = 1, b = 1, c = 0 (110) to verify that the output is 1 when both a and b are high.

scenario: BCEqualHigh
description: Set inputs a = 0, b = 1, c = 1 (011) to ensure the output is 1 when b and c are high.

scenario: AlternatingBitPattern
description: Set inputs a = 1, b = 0, c = 1 (101) to check the output is 1, verifying the function with alternating bits.
