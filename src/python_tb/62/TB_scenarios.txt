scenario: Basic State Transitions
description: Test all state transitions from S0 through S9 with sequential input patterns to verify basic functionality and next state logic

scenario: Output Verification
description: Verify correct output combinations (out1, out2) for states S7(0,1), S8(1,0), and S9(1,1), ensuring other states produce (0,0)

scenario: One-Hot Encoding Validation
description: Verify that only one bit is active in next_state[9:0] for all valid transitions, confirming proper one-hot encoding

scenario: Path to Special Output States
description: Test specific input sequences to reach states S7, S8, and S9 which have non-zero outputs

scenario: State Reset Path
description: Verify all states return to S0 when input=0, except for transitions from S5 and S6

scenario: Holding Pattern
description: Test state S7 self-loop with continuous input=1, verifying persistent (0,1) output

scenario: Multiple State Traversal
description: Test complex paths through multiple states using varying input patterns, verifying correct state sequence

scenario: Rapid Input Toggling
description: Toggle input between 0 and 1 rapidly to verify correct state transitions and output stability
