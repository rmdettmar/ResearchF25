scenario: Basic Counter Operation
description: Verify counter increments correctly from 0 to 15 over 16 clock cycles without reset

scenario: Reset During Counting
description: Assert reset signal while counter is at various values (e.g., 5, 10, 15) and verify immediate reset to 0

scenario: Counter Rollover
description: Let counter reach maximum value (15) and verify it correctly rolls over to 0 on next clock cycle

scenario: Power-on State
description: Verify counter initializes to a known state (0) on power-up before any clock edges

scenario: Multiple Reset Pulses
description: Apply multiple reset pulses in succession and verify counter remains at 0 throughout

scenario: Reset Release Timing
description: Release reset at various points relative to clock edge and verify counter starts from 0

scenario: Long-term Operation
description: Run counter for multiple complete cycles (0-15) to verify sustained correct operation
