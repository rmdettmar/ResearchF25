scenario: Basic Logic Verification
description: Apply input value 0 and verify output is 1, then apply input value 1 and verify output is 0

scenario: Signal Transition
description: Toggle input between 0 and 1 multiple times to verify correct output transitions and gate propagation delay

scenario: Glitch Detection
description: Apply rapid input transitions and verify output stability and absence of glitches during signal changes

scenario: Power-on State
description: Verify correct output state during initial power-on without explicit input assignment

scenario: Unknown Input
description: Apply 'X' (unknown) input value and verify output behavior under undefined input conditions
