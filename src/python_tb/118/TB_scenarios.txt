scenario: Initial Reset Behavior
description: Assert reset and verify FSM enters state A with z=0. Deassert reset and ensure FSM stays in state A when s=0

scenario: State A to B Transition
description: Assert s=1 while in state A and verify FSM transitions to state B. Ensure s has no effect once in state B

scenario: Exactly Two w=1 Detection
description: In state B, provide sequence w={1,1,0} and verify z=1 is generated in the following clock cycle

scenario: Less Than Two w=1 Detection
description: Test sequences w={1,0,0}, w={0,1,0}, w={0,0,1} and verify z=0 is generated in the following clock cycle

scenario: More Than Two w=1 Detection
description: Test sequence w={1,1,1} and verify z=0 is generated in the following clock cycle

scenario: Continuous Operation
description: Test multiple consecutive 3-cycle sequences with varying w patterns to verify continuous operation and correct z output

scenario: Mid-sequence Reset
description: Assert reset during w sequence counting and verify FSM returns to state A with z=0

scenario: Rapid State Changes
description: Toggle s rapidly while in state A and verify proper transition timing to state B
